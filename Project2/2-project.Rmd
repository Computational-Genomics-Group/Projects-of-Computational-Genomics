```{r}
# dataset
datafilename="/Users/paria/Documents/Computational\ Genomics/raw_trascr_count.txt"
data.ex1=read.table(datafilename,header=T) 
print(data.ex1)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
